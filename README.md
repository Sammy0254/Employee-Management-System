I have recently developed an **Employee Management System**, a web application designed to streamline employee record management with a focus on user-friendly interfaces and data security.  

🔑 **Features**:
- Add, View, Update, and Delete Employee Records.
- Secure Authentication to protect sensitive employee data.
- Built with PHP (backend), MySQL (database), and CSS for styling.  

👨‍💻 **Tech Stack**:  
PHP | MySQL | HTML | CSS | Git  

This project has helped me deepen my understanding of building secure CRUD applications while ensuring scalability and maintainability.
